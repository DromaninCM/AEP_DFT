# Introduction to Density Functional Theory

This repository contains the material for the part on "Density Functional Theory" that I taught as part of the "Advanced Experimental Physics" course (https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=03NQMPF&p_a_acc=2020&p_header=S&p_lang=) for the master students of the national and international track of the MSc program in "Physics of Complex Systems" (http://www.pcs.polito.it) held at Politecnico di Torino (Italy).
